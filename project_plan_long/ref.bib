    abstract = {The detection of anomalies in streaming data faces complexities that make traditional static methods unsuitable due to computational costs and nonstationarity. We test and evaluate eight state of the art algorithms against prominent challenges related to streaming data. Results show insights regarding accuracy, memory-dependency, parameterization, and pre-knowledge exploitation, thus revealing the high impact of some data characteristics to establish a most appropriate algorithm, namely: locality (i.e., whether outlierness is relative to local contexts), relativeness (i.e., if past data defines outlierness), and concept drift (if it is expected, its intensity and frequency). In most applied cases, such factors can be inferred in advance through the use of historical data and domain knowledge. Assuming the viability of the studied methods in terms of time efficiency, this work discloses key findings to achieve optimal designs of streaming data anomaly detection in real-life applications.}

    abstract = {Within today's large-scale systems, one anomaly can impact millions of users. Detecting such events in real-time is essential to maintain the quality of services. It allows the monitoring team to prevent or diminish the impact of a failure. Logs are a core part of software development and maintenance, by recording detailed information at runtime. Such log data are universally available in nearly all computer systems. They enable developers as well as system maintainers to monitor and dissect anomalous events. For Cloud computing companies and large online platforms in general, growth is linked to the scaling potential. Automatizing the anomaly detection process is a promising way to ensure the scalability of monitoring capacities regarding the increasing volume of logs generated by modern systems. In this paper, we will introduce MoniLog, a distributed approach to detect real-time anomalies within large-scale environments. It aims to detect sequential and quantitative anomalies within a multi-source log stream. MoniLog is designed to structure a log stream and perform the monitoring of anomalous sequences. Its output classifier learns from the administrator's actions to label and evaluate the criticality level of anomalies.}

    abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).}
